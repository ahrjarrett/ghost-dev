**Note:** Make sure you're using Node >=4.2 < 5 (use nvm if you need it)

**Instructions:**

1. Run `npm i && bower i` to install dependencies.
2. Then run `gulp ghost` to spin up a local server with live-reload.
3. Change a Sass file, it compiles automatically and the browser reloads. Change a .hbs file, Ghost restarts and the browser reloads. For other commands, see the gulp/development directory.
